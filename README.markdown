# Learning Ruby on Rails # 
I am following the book by Michael Hart, to learn
a bit about Ruby on Rails. I have some experience in Perl
and PHP, and so far this envirnment seems to be easy to use, 
for a commandline perl freak like me. promises to let one
hammer out dynamic web sites and applications pretty easily.

keywords:
1. rails and ruby installation (yesterday, a lot of stuff to install)
2. create new app, (actually a whole directory with lots of predefined
files, change the gemfile (think that was the name?)
3. and then test the basic app with the rvm serveron the local machine
(which worked without a hitch. would hav probably have walked away
if it didn't)
4 Git version control, make an account, easy, 
5 commit and push the whole basic app to the hub. now make a branch and change 
6 the README file, as I am doing right now.
